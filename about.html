    <h1>About CJâ€™s General Store</h1>
    <p>
      CJ's General Store and More is a nostalgic journey back to simpler times â€” a curated space for music lovers, dreamers, creators, and collectors.
      Built by a Gen Xâ€™er for everyone who remembers Saturday mornings, cracked sidewalks, rushing home before those Streetlights come on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're browsing the Sound Room, flipping through the Library, hanging in the Clubhouse, or just chilling at the Office,
      every corner is made with care. This isn't just a website â€” it's a time capsule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Powered by passion, and constantly evolving. Welcome home.
